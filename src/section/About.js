      <ul>
        <li>HTML5</li>
        <li>CSS3 and Sass</li>
        <li>JavaScript (ES6+)</li>
        <li>React.js</li>

      <p>I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science from XYZ University and have worked on several web development projects during my academic journey. I enjoy the process of turning ideas into reality and believe in continuous learning to stay updated with the latest trends in the industry.</p>

      <p>Outside of coding, I love playing soccer, volunteering at local tech events, and exploring new coffee shops in the city.</p>
